# Text Summarizer

Text summarization refers to the technique of shortening long pieces of text. The intention is to create a coherent and fluent summary having only the main points outlined in the document.
Automatic text summarization is a common problem in machine learning and natural language processing (NLP).

Text summarization can broadly be divided into two categories â€” Extractive Summarization and Abstractive Summarization.

1. Extractive Summarization: These methods rely on extracting several parts, such as phrases and sentences, from a piece of text and stack them together to create a summary. Therefore, identifying the right sentences for summarization is of utmost importance in an extractive method.
2. Abstractive Summarization: These methods use advanced NLP techniques to generate an entirely new summary. Some parts of this summary may not even appear in the original text.
